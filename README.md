### What is FIRST?
FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) sponsors FIRST Robotics Competition every year with a new game type. This is a solution using computer vision that is applicable to the challenge.

### What features does this provide?
This allows for detection of the grey tote, the yellow tote, and the recycle bin (green bin internally). It provides for the rotation to line up with each object as well as orientation for strafing to the short side of a box. It returns how many totes are in a stack and whether a stack has a recycle bin on top of it.
